# etf_project

This project is designed to demonstrate advanced financial modeling skills alongside technical proficiency in web development. It serves as a platform to showcase the calculation of key financial metrics, including beta, Sharpe ratio, and cumulative returns, which are essential for analyzing investment performance. Additionally, the project highlights my capabilities in setting up user interfaces and configuring backend services using Python.

## Technical Implementation:

# Web Application Framework: 
The application is built on Flask, a lightweight and powerful Python web framework. Flask acts as the middleware, facilitating the interaction between the web frontend and the Python code execution in the backend. This setup allows for dynamic data processing and responsive interaction with the user.
#  Frontend Development: 
The user interface is constructed using HTML, enhanced with CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity. This approach provides a clean and intuitive user interface that makes the financial data easily accessible and understandable to users.
# Financial Calculations: 

The core functionality of the application involves financial calculations and charting against the SPY and RFR:
Beta: Measures the volatility of an investment compared to the market as a whole.
Sharpe Ratio: Used to understand the return of an investment compared to its risk.
Cumulative Returns: Tracks the aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time.
Best performing quarter: Best quarter of the year on average 

#Purpose and Functionality:

The primary aim of this project is to merge sophisticated financial analysis with robust web technology, providing a practical tool for users to evaluate investment performance. The application not only performs intricate calculations but also displays these calculations through a well-designed web interface, ensuring that users can make informed financial decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.
